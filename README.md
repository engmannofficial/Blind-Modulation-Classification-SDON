# Blind Modulation Classification of Software-Defined Optical Networks (SDON)

## Background
Modern optical networks require intelligent mechanisms to identify modulation formats without prior knowledge of the transmitted signal. Blind modulation classification is essential for adaptive and software-defined optical networking environments.

## Problem Statement
Traditional modulation identification techniques are limited in dynamic and heterogeneous optical networks. This project investigates the use of machine learning techniques to classify modulation schemes in Software-Defined Optical Networks without prior signal information.

## Methodology
- Simulation of multiple optical modulation schemes
- Feature extraction from received signals
- Machine learning-based classification
- Performance evaluation using classification accuracy

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Machine Learning techniques

## Key Results
The study demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively classify modulation formats in SDON environments, improving network adaptability and intelligence.

## Future Work
- Extend the model to additional modulation schemes
- Evaluate performance under noise and channel impairments
- Explore deep learning-based classifiers
